Welcome to PyOmicron's documentation!
=====================================

PyOmicron is a workflow generator and processor tool for the `Omicron gravitational-wave event trigger generator <https://virgo.docs.ligo.org/virgoapp/Omicron/>`_. It was built chiefly to simplify the automatic processing hundreds of data channels recorded by the `Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu>`_ and `Virgo <https://www.ego-gw.it/>`_ detectors in order to characterise the instrumental and environmental noises impacting their sensitivity.

Installing PyOmicron
--------------------

The easiest method to install PyOmicron is using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ directly from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ligovirgo/pyomicron.git>`_:
